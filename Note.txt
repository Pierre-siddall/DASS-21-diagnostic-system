I'm too depressed to write a long suicide note.
I missed out on my teen years I never been asked out to prom nor have I been to any HS parties. (I'm going into my senior year this august) i'm almost an adult and haven't accomplished anything whatsoever.
I'm also fucking terrible at driving, I can't parallel park for the life of me.
Recently lost my job so there's that. Life can't get any worse than this.
