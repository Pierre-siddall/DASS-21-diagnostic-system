It’s my first post here and I’m crying in my bed right now. I’m so tired, and feeling so stressed about being like that and I don’t know what to do anymore, I’ve tried. I take my medications. I’ll start swimming 3 days/week, I’m learning how to drive, I’m planning to buy a car with the help of my mom and I really have an amazing boyfriend so kind to me. But doesn’t matter. I’m always sad. I’m always stressed. I’m always crying. If my mom were not here I swear that I would consider taking my life away, but since im her only daughter I could never. I wish I was a kid again. I wish I could start all over, just for the good feeling the I use to have. I just want to feel myself again For my boyfriend, I feel so sad that such a good men doesn’t have such a women thats on his level
